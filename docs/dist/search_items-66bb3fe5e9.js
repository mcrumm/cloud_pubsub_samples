Installation First, clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/mcrumm/cloud_pubsub_samples.git cd cloud_pubsub_samples Next, install and compile the app: mix do deps.get, compile Now you&#39;re ready to setup your Google Cloud Project! Getting Started Create your Google Cloud Project First, you need to create a Google Cloud Project and a Service Account with the proper permissions for managing Cloud Pub/Sub resources. The Broadway project on HexDocs has a great tutorial for Google Cloud Project setup. You can skip the steps about creating a topic and subscription, but be sure to create your Service Account, bind it with the proper permissions, and create a credentials file for authentication. Configure Application Credentials With credentials in hand, we can configure our environment to authenticate with Google. By default, this app will look for credentials in the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS System environment variable. Be sure to set the absolute path to your credentials file: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=&quot;/path/to/my/credentials.json&quot; Create Resources To use Google Cloud Pub/Sub, we need a topic and a subscription. Messages are published to topics and received by subscriptions. Create a topic: mix publisher.create test-topic Created topic projects/test-project/topics/test-topic And a subscription for the topic: mix subscriber.create test-topic test-subscription Created subscription projects/test-project/subscriptions/test-subscription The Google Cloud Project is derived from the application credentials. Start listening for messages Start a subscriber for the subscription we just created: mix subscriber.start test-subscription Listening for messages on projects/test-project/subscriptions/test-subscription - Press Ctrl+C to exit Publish messages Open a new tab. Don&#39;t forget to export your application credentials. Publish some messages to the topic: mix publisher.publish test-topic Published message 1 Published message 2 Published message 3 Published message 4 Published message 5 Published message 6 Published message 7 Published message 8 Published message 9 Published message 10 Switch back to the subscriber tab. You should see output similar to: Received message from Cloud Pub/Sub: Message ID: 757042663206915 Publish Time: 2019-09-22 19:16:25.183Z Attributes: nil The message data: &quot;Message number 1&quot; Received message from Cloud Pub/Sub: ...
